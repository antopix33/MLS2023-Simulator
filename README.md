# MLS 2023 Simulator

#### 3/7/2023

This is my first real OOP project I will be attempting outside of my course projects. 

I will be simulating a 2023 regular season Major League Soccer table and the corresponding playoffs bracket at the end of the season. Partcipating teams, rules, and other statistics can be found here:

The 2023 MLS Season introduced many new things to their playoff format, which could lead to interesting edge-cases. Details can be found here:
